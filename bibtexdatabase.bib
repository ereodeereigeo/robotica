  abstract = {Abstract While expected applications of Modular Robotic Systems (MRS)
	span various workspaces, scales, and structures, practical implementations
	of such systems lag behind their potentials in performing real-world
	tasks. Challenges of enhancing \{MRS\} capabilities not only are
	limited to designing reliable, responsive, and robust hardware, but
	also include developing software and algorithms that can effectively
	fulfill tasks through performing fundamental functions like shape-formation,
	locomotion, manipulation, etc. Thus, \{MRS\} solution methods must
	be able to resolve problems arising from the tightly-coupled kinematics
	of interconnected modules and their inherent limitations in resources,
	communication, connection strength, etc. in performing such functions
	through domain-specific operations including Self-reconfiguration,
	Flow, Gait, Self-assembly, Self-disassembly, Self-adaptation, Grasping,
	Collective actuation, and Enveloping. Despite the large number of
	developed solution methods, there is no inclusive and updated study
	in the literature dedicated to classifying, analyzing, and comparing
	their specifications and capabilities in a systematic manner. This
	paper aims to fill in this gap through reviewing 64 solution methods
	and algorithms according to their application in each operation and
	by investigating their capabilities in (1) modeling and simplifying
	\{MRS\} problems through Abstraction methods, (2) solving \{MRS\}
	problems through Solution and Control methods, and (3) coordinating
	actions of modules through Synchronization methods. Challenging issues
	of each solution approach along with their advantages and weaknesses
	are also analyzed and open problems and improvement outlooks are
	mentioned. Overall, this paper aims to investigate the research areas
	in \{MRS\} algorithms that have been evolved so far and to explore
	promising research directions for the future. },

  abstract = {Abstract Rapid prototyping is a key aspect for the development of
	innovative robotic applications. A modular, platform-based, approach
	is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for
	software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing
	solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should
	be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by
	the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application
	idea. To overcome this problem, we propose \{R2P\} (Rapid Robot Prototyping),
	a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for
	robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors,
	actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which
	can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. \{R2P\} provides hardware
	modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to
	connect components as well as tools to support the development of
	software on the modules. \{R2P\} aims at dramatically reduce time
	and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible
	to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications
	instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also
	people with experience in a specific application domain, but with
	little technical background, to actively participate in the development
	of new robotic applications. \{R2P\} is open-source both in its software
	and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community
	and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs
	to design a new robotic product.},

	learns by reasoning throughout the process. In case of an unresolved
	condition, human assistance is given and the corresponding knowledge
	will be learned by demonstration. The process can be performed more
	efficiently by applying a revision strategy that optimises the operation
